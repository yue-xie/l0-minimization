# l0-minimization
These are the matlab soure code for the numerical experiments in the paper 
"Tractable ADMM Schemes for Computing KKT Points and Local Minimizers for $\ell_0$-Minimization Problems" by Yue Xie and Uday Shanbhag.

Comparison_convex_vs_nonconvex_v2.m and hiddenconvex_vs_nonhiddenconvex_v3.m are for the numerical experiment in Secion 5.2;
Comparison5.m and Algorithms4.m are for the numerical experiment in Section 5.3.
